/this is where thoughts about the brain come in/

- initial thought of this brain came from me wanting to capture what i want to do with emacs but this could very well apply to other things as well, like projects, uni and basically most of my live that needs a bit more structure

- having a main inbox and inboxes about the different parts so i either put stuff in the main inbox and sort it later or put it directly in a specified inbox
