Abstract
In machine Learning and Large Scale data Science Projects Large data-
Sets are used to in crease the quality of the results. Data like
that is offen recorded by sensors or typed in by hand. This can had
to data being missing, either due to fault y sensors or human error.
Miss ing Data quickly cause s problems so it needs to be dealt uith. Betet.
ing eutnies with wissing value s can cause problems when the Size of the
data set is important for the quality of the results. There for the missing
values nee d to be impwtated. In the paper "Parti oued predictive mean matching
as a Large data multi Level imputation technique" by Gerko Kirk, Goran Lazar dia
and Stef van Buuren, the Predictive mean matching method is used on
a Large data set by partioning it into sm aller clusters. The missing value s
are then impnlated by ma King a regression model of non-missiug value s and
random by chasing a donor rahe from n of the closed value s. W here u
is vsually 5 but can be I or to dep ending on the implementation.
* introduction
-Intro duce the problem of missing raten es
- expla in the problems wissing data into duos
-Touch on why ddcting ent ries with miss ing value s can be problem aka
- ex plain the importance of good imputation
-comp are the types of missing data
* relating work
-Imputation using mean/median Value s
-pros:
• easy and fast
• wo das well with Shall numerical data sets
-contra
• doesn't factor in condition between rohes
• not very accurale
• doesn't work well or at all on non-numerical valucs
• doesn't account for the uncertainty in the imputation
- Imp nation using most frequent or Zero konstant values
- pro:
• work s hell on non-numerical data
-contra:
• also doesn't factor the in the corre Latin between vala es
• can intro dna bias in the data
-Imputation by sloohastic regression
-pro:
• factors in corre la ti on of Vala es
- contra
• Only work s on numerical data
• can had to on reali die data Outside of a given value-range
* methods
­-exp.la in the predictive mean matching method
-Talk about the problems that can a rise when it is used on Large mutti Level
data sets
-ex plain the parlioned Predictive mean matching pro posed in the paper
"Parti oued predictive mean matching as a Large data multi Level imputation
technique" by Gerko Kirk, Goran Lazar dia and Stef van Buuren
* evaluation
- evaluale the results of the simulation in the paper
* discussion
­-eomparethepp.mn method with the other methods used in the Simulation
in the paper
-dis aus the quality of the ppmm method
-talk about what problems could happen with the dust ering
-discuss how the method can be improved and what research has to
happen to be Her understand the method and how sample size and
cluster size impact the results
